## About Our Web Application:-

Consuming nutritious and delicious food has become a challenge in today's society mainly due to busy lifestyles. However, we have introduced the perfect solution for food lovers who are interested in maintaining a healthy diet.  

We have developed a website specifically designed for individuals who are seeking tasty and healthy food options. Our website features a wide range of recipes published by experienced chefs. Anyone can visit our website and explore the collection of recipes available. But to add recipes as a chef or buy recipes as a customer requires registration in the system.
